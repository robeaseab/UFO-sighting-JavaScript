# JavaScript and DOM Manipulation

#### See my final product here: [link to UFO-Sighting ](https://robeaseab.github.io/UFO-sighting-JavaScript/)

For this project I wrote a code that created a table dynamically based upon a UFO sighting [dataset]( https://github.com/robeaseab/UFO-sighting-JavaScript/blob/master/static/js/data.js). The code I wrote allows users to filter the table data for specific values. This was created using only pure JavaScript, HTML, and CSS, and D3.js on my web pages. 

I created a basic HTML web page (see index.html). Using the UFO dataset in the form of an array of JavaScript objects, I then wrote code that appends a table to my web page and then adds new rows of data for each UFO sighting.  The table contains columns for `date/time`, `city`, `state`, `country`, `shape`, and `comment`.  

I used a form in my HTML document and wrote JavaScript code that listens for events and search through the appropriate column to find rows that match user input.  The user is able to search via multiple input choices.
